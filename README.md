# Software-Engineering-Semester-Project
Given a framework created by professor, two team members and I were able to improve and add additional features to the framework.
We created a game similar to Cuphead.  There are three rooms with three different bosses.  As the player you must defeat each boss 
before being able to move to the next room.  You win by succesfully defeating all three bosses! Good luck!
